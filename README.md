* Step 1: Training and deployment on Sagemaker  

  * Check [the screenshots](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SJTQBwdd3jptwA0SDJCbmpsjjIWyN9h1s9LYEoFcw_U)  

  * Set up VPC   
     
    Since my current role doesn't have the permissions to create an `Internet Gateway`, `NAT Gateway`, or assign an `Elastic IP` address, I set up a SageMaker notebook instance in the default VPC's public subnet in one of the Availability Zones. I enabled direct internet access for the instance so the notebook kernel can update Python libraries.

  * Set up S3 bucket  

    The dog images uploaded for Project 2 from an S3 bucket in another account was reused. To do this, I created an `S3 Gateway` endpoint within the VPC and updated the S3 bucket policy to enable cross-account access.

  * Training

    The `train_and_deploy-solution.ipynb` and `hpo.py` files were uploaded to the notebook instance and ran the notebook. The HPO job, which had 2 runs on an `ml.g4dn.xlarge` instance, took about 40 minutes. Afterward, using the 'best hyperparameters,' I ran a multi-instance training job on two `ml.g4dn.xlarge` instances.

    I chose the `ml.g4dn.xlarge` instance because it's one of the smaller GPU options, and it worked very well for the image classification task in Project 3 training.

  * Deployment

    The `inference2.py` file was uploaded to the notebook instance, deployed an inference endpoint, and tested it. Since the focus of this project is on ML operations, inference accuracy isn't the primary concern.

  * Clean up resources

    Afterwards, the model, endpoint, and notebook instance were deleted.
